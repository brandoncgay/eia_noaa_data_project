    description: "The fact_noaa_data model is a fact table that combines data from the raw_noaa_data and noaa_stations models. It includes the date, element, and data_value columns from the raw_noaa_data model, and the latitude, longitude, and state columns from the noaa_stations model. The SQL query filters the data to include only records where the element is one of the following: 'TMIN', 'TMAX', 'PRCP', 'SNOW', 'SNWD', 'TSUN', 'WDMV', and where the state is not null."
    columns:
      - name: date
        description: "The date column represents the date on which the weather data was recorded. It is in the format YYYY-MM-DD."
