  - name: dim_eia_plants_with_noaa_stations
    description: "The 'dim_eia_plants_with_noaa_stations' model is a comprehensive dataset that combines information from three different sources: plant data, generator data, and plants with nearest station data. It includes details about the utility, the plant, its location, the balancing authority, the technologies used, the energy sources, the nearest NOAA station, and the distance to that station. The model is created by joining the 'tmp_plant_data', 'tmp_generator_data', and 'tmp_plants_with_nearest_station' tables on the 'PLANT_CODE' field."
