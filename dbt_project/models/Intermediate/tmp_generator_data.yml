models:
  - name: tmp_generator_data
    description: The tmp_generator_data model is a summary of generator data. It includes information about the utility, the plant, and the technologies and energy sources used. The data is grouped by utility ID, utility name, plant code, plant name, state, and county. The TECHNOLOGIES and ENERGY_SOURCES columns are arrays that contain the distinct technologies and energy sources used by each group.
