  - name: tmp_plants_with_nearest_station
    description: "The 'tmp_plants_with_nearest_station' model is designed to provide information about the nearest station to each plant. It contains three columns: PLANT_CODE, STATION_ID, and DISTANCE_M. The PLANT_CODE is a numerical identifier for each plant. The STATION_ID is a string identifier for each station. The DISTANCE_M is a floating point number representing the minimum distance in meters between a plant and its nearest station. The model is created by joining the 'stations_with_nearest_plant' table with a subquery that calculates the minimum distance for each plant."
